<sect>Notice
<p>The Squid Team are pleased to announce the release of Squid-5.0.0 for testing.

This new release is available for download from <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/"> or the
 <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Download/http-mirrors.html" name="mirrors">.

<p>While this release is not deemed ready for production use, we believe it is ready for wider testing by the community.

<p>We welcome feedback and bug reports. If you find a bug, please see <url url="http://wiki.squid-cache.org/SquidFaq/BugReporting">
   for how to submit a report with a stack trace.

<sect1>Known issues
<p>Although this release is deemed good enough for use in many setups, please note the existence of 
<url url="http://bugs.squid-cache.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&amp;product=Squid&amp;bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&amp;bug_status=NEW&amp;bug_status=ASSIGNED&amp;bug_status=REOPENED&amp;version=5" name="open bugs against Squid-5">.

<sect1>Changes since earlier releases of Squid-5
<p>
The Squid-4 change history can be <url url="http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/changesets/" name="viewed here">.


<sect>Major new features since Squid-4
<p>Squid-5 represents a new feature release above Squid-4.

<p>The most important of these new features are:
<itemize>
	<item>SSL Support removal
</itemize>

Most user-facing changes are reflected in squid.conf (see below).


<sect1>SSL Support removal
<p>Details in <url url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6176" name="RFC 6176">
   and <url url="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7568" name="RFC 7568">

<p>SSLv2 is not fit for purpose. Squid no longer supports being configured with
   any settings regarding this protocol. That includes settings manually disabling
   its use since it is now forced to disable by default. Also settings enabling
   various client/server workarounds specific to SSLv2 are removed.

<p>SSLv3 is not fit for purpose. Squid still accepts configuration, but use
   is deprecated and will be removed entirely in a future version.
   Squid default behavour is to follow the TLS built in negotiation mechanism
   which prefers the latest TLS version. But also to accept downgrades to SSLv3.
   Use <em>tls-options=NO_SSLv3</em> to disable SSLv3 support completely.
